## Functional Requirements
- The main page must list all blog posts in reverse chronological order.
- An "About Me" page must be accessible from the main navigation.
- Each post must support categories and tags for filtering and browsing.
- A visible link to the author's GitHub profile must be present.
- A visible link to the author's LinkedIn profile must be present.

## Success Criteria
- Users can view all blog posts on the main page.
- Users can access the "About Me" page from the navigation.
- Users can filter or browse posts by category or tag.
- Users can open the author's GitHub profile from the blog.
- Users can open the author's LinkedIn profile from the blog.

## Assumptions
- The blog will be built using Hugo.
- No user authentication is required for visitors.
- All content (posts, pages, categories, tags) is managed directly via files (Markdown/front matter). No admin/editor UI is provided.
- Categories and tags are dynamic and user-defined in the front matter of each post. There is no fixed or predefined set.
- Each blog post is uniquely identified by its file path (relative to the content directory) and publication date, following Hugo's default behavior. Duplicate slugs or titles are not allowed within the same directory and date.
- Blog posts support draft/published states using Hugo's built-in `draft: true/false` front matter. Only published posts (draft: false or no draft field) are visible on the live site.

## Key Entities
- Blog Post (title, content, date, categories, tags)
- Author (name, bio, GitHub link, LinkedIn link)

## Out of Scope
- Comments (no comment functionality)
- Search (no search bar or search functionality)
- RSS feed (no RSS or Atom feed)
- Analytics (no tracking or analytics integration)
- Multi-author support (single author only)
- Any contact method other than GitHub/LinkedIn links

## Error and Empty States
- If the GitHub or LinkedIn link is missing, the corresponding icon or link is not shown on the blog.
- If a link is present but invalid, clicking it will result in the browser's default error (no custom error handling).

## Accessibility and Localization
- The blog must meet full accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA or higher), including but not limited to: alt text for all images, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, sufficient color contrast, and skip navigation links.
- The blog must support multiple languages (localization), with at least English and German (Deutsch). All user-facing text must be translatable, and language switching must be available in the UI.
