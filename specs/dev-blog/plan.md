# Implementation Plan: dev-blog

**Branch**: `[dev-blog]` | **Date**: 2025-10-17 | **Spec**: [specs/dev-blog/spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/dev-blog/spec.md`

## Summary

Create a personal developer blog using Hugo. The main page lists all blog posts. There is an About Me page, categories and tags for navigation, and visible links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. The site must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA+), support at least two languages, and avoid unnecessary dependencies/plugins for maintainability and performance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Hugo (Go-based SSG), config in YAML/TOML/JSON  
**Primary Dependencies**: Hugo core only (no extra plugins unless absolutely necessary)  
**Storage**: Markdown files for content, front matter for metadata  
**Testing**: Manual and automated checks for accessibility, navigation, and content rendering  
**Target Platform**: Static web (any modern browser)  
**Project Type**: Single static site  
**Performance Goals**: Fast load times (<1s for main page), Lighthouse performance >90  
**Constraints**: No unnecessary dependencies/plugins, minimal custom JS, must meet accessibility and localization requirements  
**Scale/Scope**: Single author, up to hundreds of posts, 2+ languages

## Constitution Check
- Simplicity: No unnecessary dependencies/plugins, minimal custom code
- Maintainability: All content in Markdown, clear structure, no complex build steps
- Automated Testing: Accessibility and navigation checks (manual/automated)
- Traceable Changes: All changes via version control
- Minimal Dependencies: Hugo core only, no extra plugins unless justified
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance
- Localization: At least English and one more language

└── i18n/                # Localization files
```

### Key Steps
1. Initialize Hugo site and configure for multi-language support
2. Define content structure: posts, about, categories, tags
3. Implement navigation and layouts (WCAG 2.1 AA+)
4. Add GitHub and LinkedIn links (configurable in site params)
5. Add i18n files and language switcher
6. Test accessibility, navigation, and language switching
7. Document setup, content creation, and maintenance

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Accessibility**: Use Hugo best practices, test with Lighthouse/axe
- **Localization**: Use Hugo i18n, keep all text in translation files
- **Performance**: Avoid heavy JS, optimize images, use Hugo’s built-in features
- **Maintainability**: No custom plugins unless justified, document all custom code

### Out of Scope
- Comments, search, RSS, analytics multi-author, any contact method other than GitHub/LinkedIn links
