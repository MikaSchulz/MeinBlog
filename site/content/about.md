# About Me

Hi, I’m Mika, a software developer currently working at Otto GmbH & Co. KGaA.
My passion for IT started at a young age, and ever since, I’ve been hooked. It all began with
Minecraft modding, where I first got hands-on with Java, explored the basics of software
architecture, and even got a taste of project management.

Over time, I turned this passion into a career, deepening my skills during my apprenticeship as an
IT specialist in application development (Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung). Today, I work
as a Java developer at Otto GmbH & Co. KGaA, always eager to experiment, learn new things, and
tackle exciting challenges along the way.
