# MeinBlog Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity
The project must be kept as simple as possible. Complexity should be avoided unless strictly necessary for functionality.

### II. Maintainability
The code and project structure must be designed to allow easy future changes and extensions.

### III. Automated Testing
The most important features and pages are covered by automated tests. Tests are mandatory before merging new features.

### IV. Traceable Changes
All changes to the project must be traceable (e.g., through commit messages and pull requests).

### V. Minimal Dependencies
No large or unnecessary dependencies are allowed. External libraries are only used if they provide clear value.

## Governance
This constitution takes precedence over other project practices. Changes to the constitution must be documented and recorded in the repository. Versioning follows semantic rules (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Compliance is checked with every merge.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Initial ratification | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-17
